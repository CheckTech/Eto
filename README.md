Description
-----------

This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

The overall goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional
applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit.  This will make your applications look and 
work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI
in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac, and GTK#.
There is a Mobile/iOS port in the works, but is considered incomplete.

This framework was built so that using it in .NET is natural. For example, a simple hello-world application might look like:

	public class MyForm : Form
	{
		public MyForm ()
		{
			Text = "My Cross-Platform App";
			Size = new Size (200, 200);
			var label = new Label { Text = "Hello World!" };
			this.AddDockedControl (label);
		}
		
		[STAThread]
		static void Main () {
			var app = new Application();
			app.Initialized += delegate {
				app.MainForm = new MyForm ();
				app.MainForm.Show ();
			};
			app.Run ();
		}
	}
